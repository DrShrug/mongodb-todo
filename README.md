# NodeJS Todo Backend
This project was create in order to learn how to create a seperate frontend and backend using VueJs and Node Express. This also doesn't have a name because I'm bad with names.

This is a NodeJs API which will send data to the frontend developed [here](https://github.com/PhuLN/NodeJS-Front-End).

## Features

* Authentication system using a username and password (No OAuth2 though)
* Easy group creation
* Real time updates (group invites, todo changes)
* Very basic overview of a group's todolist (late, completed table with details, basic graphs, etc)
* Member management with a click of a button (adding and removing members from your group can be done in seconds)
* Full (?) english and french translation
